				<p>About: I was born in Islamabad, Pakistan. I am a rising junior at Amherst college, majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I enjoy learning new ways in which computer science shapes the world and how it interacts with almost every other disciple. I have always been drawn towards languages, so I try to learn a new one whenever I get the chance. In my free time, I brush up on my german skills or do HIIT.</p>

				<p>Email:<a href = "mailto: mkironde@smith.edu">mkironde@smith.edu</a></p>
				<p>About: As an upcoming computer engineer, I love learning about systems and how they behave. So naturally, I was drawn towards learning about small world networks, and how they influence how we think about the internet, epidemics, and so much more. Outside of stem, I enjoy dancing, playing soccer and reading lots of books, especially African literature.</p>
